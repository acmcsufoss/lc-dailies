## Seasons

Seasons are week-long competitions that reset every Sunday at midnight UTC. The
goal of each season is for each player to submit an accepted solution to as many
of Leetcode's daily challenges as fast as possible.

- The JSON API for our live season results is available at
  <https://lc-dailies.deno.dev/seasons/latest>.
- All seasons are available at <https://lc-dailies.deno.dev/seasons>.

## `/lc` slash command

The `/lc` slash command is a Discord application command that allows members of
the ACM CSUF Discord server to participate in weekly Leetcode competitions that
automatically reset every Sunday at midnight UTC.

### Security

This tool takes advantage of Discord's permissions system to elevate the
security of `/lc`, allowing only verified members of the ACM CSUF Discord server
to play in our automated weekly competitions.

### Operate with confidence

The software is a
[Discord slash command](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands).
All that is required to use the tool is a Discord account with the `Verified`
role on the [ACM CSUF Discord server](https://acmcsuf.com/discord).

- This slash command is only available to members with the `Verified` role.
- This slash command is available in all text channels of the
